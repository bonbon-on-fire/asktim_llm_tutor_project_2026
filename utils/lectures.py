"""Lecture-transcript discovery shared across context builders.

A course may ship lecture transcripts (plain text) under
``curriculum/<course>/lectures/``. These are folded into the tutor's context
so it can ground guidance in what was actually taught, not just the exercise
prompt. Per the 06/09/2026 design decision, transcripts are included
**per-course** (all lectures for the course), mirroring how ``course.txt`` and
``syllabus.txt`` are treated.

Text-only and additive: when the folder or files are absent this returns an
empty string, so existing courses (and the deployed app) are unaffected.
