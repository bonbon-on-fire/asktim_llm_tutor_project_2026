"""Figure discovery and multimodal-content helpers shared across modules.

Curriculum exercises may ship visual context (maps, diagrams) under
``curriculum/<course>/figures/``. This module turns those files into the
normalized multimodal content blocks that LangChain forwards to both OpenAI
and Anthropic vision models, so the tutor / student / judge can reason over
the real figure instead of a secondhand prose description.

Mirrors the small, dependency-free style of :mod:`utils.parsing`.

Naming convention (strict): ``exercise_<NN>_<slug>.<ext>`` where ``<NN>`` is a
two-digit exercise number and ``<ext>`` is one of ``png``, ``jpg``, ``jpeg``
(case-insensitive). Multiple figures per exercise are allowed and returned
sorted by filename. A figure serves exactly one exercise.
