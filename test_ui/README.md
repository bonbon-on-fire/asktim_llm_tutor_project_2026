# test_ui — AskTIM Sandbox

Developer/TA **testing website** for the tutor. It mirrors the student-facing
[`main_ui/`](../main_ui/README.md) chat experience — token-streamed replies,
persistent cross-session history, email + password identity — but adds an
**Edit context** switcher so a tester can change course, exercise, tutor prompt,
and the syllabus toggle on the fly, and runs against its **own separate
database** so test chats never touch production data.

Branding is deliberately distinct from production: the accent is teal-blue
(`#126f9a`) instead of MIT crimson, and the header reads **AskTIM · Sandbox Beta**.

## What it shares with main_ui

- iframe-style chat at `/embed?course=...&exercise=...&tutor=...` (and a bare `/` that uses defaults)
- Server-Sent Events streaming — tutor replies token-by-token, `pedagogical-reasoning` hidden server-side
- Sanitized-markdown rendering of tutor replies (tables/lists/bold) — `marked` → `DOMPurify`, same `setMessageContent()` path as `main_ui`
- Conversation / Message / Student tables; email + password identity (bcrypt), cross-browser history sidebar
- The same tutor pipeline via `tutor.run_tutor` (through `services/tutor_bridge.py`)

## What's different

| | `main_ui/` (production) | `test_ui/` (this app) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audience | Real OCW students | Developers / TAs |
| Context | Fixed per iframe URL | **Editable in-app** via the "Edit context" button |
| Syllabus | Always included if present | **Toggleable** per conversation |
| Database | Postgres `asktim` (`DATABASE_URL`) | **Separate Postgres** `asktim_test`, also via `DATABASE_URL` (each Railway service has its own env, so the same var name resolves to a different DB per service) |
| Schema mgmt | Alembic migrations | `Base.metadata.create_all` on boot (throwaway DB) |
| Accent / header | Crimson · Beta | `#126f9a` · **Sandbox Beta** |
| Port | `5001` | `5000` |

Both apps can run side by side.

## The "Edit context" switcher

The solid-blue **Edit context** button (top of the sidebar, above "Add email")
opens a modal to choose:

- **Course** — any folder under `curriculum/`
- **Exercise** — exercises available for the chosen course
- **Tutor prompt** — `tutor_01`–`tutor_05`
- **Include course syllabus** — folds `syllabus.txt` into the tutor context (disabled for courses that have none)

Applying a change **starts a fresh conversation** under the new settings; the
previous chat stays in history. The chosen syllabus flag is stored per
conversation, so reopening a past chat replays it with the same context.

## Quick start

```powershell
python -m test_ui
```

Binds to `127.0.0.1:5000` by default. Override with the `PORT` env var.

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/embed?course=cities_and_climate_change&exercise=01&tutor=tutor_05
```

Health check:

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
# {"service":"test_ui","status":"ok"}
```

## Environment variables

`.env` at the repo root is auto-loaded on import.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Required for the tutor LLM call. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required only if a tutor prompt points at Claude. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./test_ui.db` (fallback) | Postgres URL for the Sandbox's **own** database (e.g. `asktim_test`). Same var name as main_ui, but on Railway each service's env resolves it to a different Postgres. ⚠️ Locally the two apps share the root `.env`, so if `DATABASE_URL` is set there, point it at a throwaway DB — otherwise the Sandbox writes into whatever production uses. Unset → SQLite `test_ui.db`. |
| `TEST_UI_SECRET_KEY` | `dev-insecure-key` | Flask session signing key. |
| `TEST_UI_COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Defaults off so identity/history work over local http. Set `true` behind HTTPS. |
| `TEST_UI_COOKIE_MAX_AGE` | `15552000` (180 days) | Cookie lifetime in seconds. |
| `PORT` | `5000` | TCP port the dev server binds to. |

## Database

No Alembic. On boot, `create_app()` calls `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`
to build the schema directly from the models into whatever `DATABASE_URL`
points at. By default that's its **own Postgres database** (`asktim_test`),
separate from main_ui's `asktim` so test chats never mix with production data
(falls back to a local SQLite file if the var is unset). The schema matches
`main_ui` plus a `conversations.syllabus_enabled` column and the
`conversations.custom_*` columns that store one-off custom contexts.

The database must already exist (`CREATE DATABASE asktim_test;`); `create_all`
then builds the tables. To reset the sandbox data, drop and recreate that
database.

> **Design decision (2026-06-04) — why `DATABASE_URL`, not `TEST_UI_DATABASE_URL`.**
> test_ui originally read a prefixed `TEST_UI_DATABASE_URL` so that, with both
> apps loading the *same* root `.env`, you couldn't accidentally point the
> Sandbox at the production DB. In practice this caused a recurring deploy
> footgun: the Railway test service was set up with a plain `DATABASE_URL`
> variable (matching Railway's default Postgres reference), the app didn't read
> it, silently fell back to ephemeral SQLite, and "data wasn't saving."
>
> We unified on `DATABASE_URL` for both apps. On Railway each service has its own
> isolated environment, so `humanities-main` and `humanities-test` still resolve
> the same var name to **different** Postgres instances — and whatever Railway
> wires up by default just works.
>
> **The trade-off we accepted:** locally both apps share one `.env`, so a
> `DATABASE_URL` set there is used by *both*. The SQLite fallback is still
> test-specific (`test_ui.db`), so an *unset* local env keeps them separate; but
> if you set `DATABASE_URL` locally, point it at a throwaway DB or the Sandbox
> will write into whatever it names. If you ever run both apps locally against
> two real Postgres DBs at once, revisit this (per-app prefixes, or separate
> `.env` files / processes).
>
> **Unrelated reminder:** the Sandbox needs its **own empty** Postgres. Pointing
> `DATABASE_URL` at a main_ui-shaped DB fails — that `conversations` table lacks
> `syllabus_enabled`/`custom_*`, and `create_all` only creates missing *tables*,
> it never adds columns to existing ones.

## API surface

Same as `main_ui` (`/embed`, `/health`, `/api/whoami`, `/api/chat`,
`/api/identity[/check]`, `/api/history`, `/api/conversation/<uuid>`), plus:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/context/options` | Courses (with their exercises + syllabus availability) and tutor prompts, for the Edit-context switcher |

`POST /api/chat` additionally accepts an optional `"syllabus": true|false` field
(defaults to `true`) that gates the syllabus block for a new conversation.

## Deployment

Containerized separately from main_ui via the root **[`Dockerfile_test`](../Dockerfile_test)**
(main_ui uses `Dockerfile_main`). It copies `test_ui/`, `tutor/`, `curriculum/`,
`utils/` and runs [`scripts/railway-entrypoint-test.sh`](../scripts/railway-entrypoint-test.sh),
which validates `OPENAI_API_KEY`, normalizes `DATABASE_URL` to the
`postgresql+psycopg://` scheme, then starts `gunicorn test_ui.run_app:app` on
`$PORT` (default 5000). No Alembic step — `create_all` builds the schema on boot,
so the target database just needs to exist (and must be the Sandbox's **own**
empty DB — pointing it at main_ui's Postgres fails, since that table is missing
test_ui's `syllabus_enabled`/`custom_*` columns and `create_all` won't add them).
Set `DATABASE_URL` (and the API keys) on the Railway service. Build locally with
`docker build -f Dockerfile_test -t asktim-sandbox .`.
