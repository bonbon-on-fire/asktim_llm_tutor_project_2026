**FOUNDATION BUILT 2026-06-15.** `utils/figures.py` + `utils/lectures.py` exist (with `utils/test_figures.py`, `utils/test_lectures.py`, all passing). Figures threaded through the **non-streaming** tutor (`create_tutor_graph(..., figures=)`), student (`get_next_student_message(..., figures=)`), judge (reads transcript `figures` field, re-resolves + re-attaches), and `internal_ui/run_ui_raw.py` (discovers + writes `"figures": [...]`). Lecture transcripts: per-course `curriculum/<course>/lectures/*.txt`, folded into both internal_ui and main_ui context builders. Message sanitizers in tutor/student now handle multimodal list content.

**STILL OPEN:** the `main_ui` **streaming** path (deployed app still text-only — wiring figures into `stream_tutor_reply`/`StudentAnswerExtractor` is the next step and the prerequisite for main_ui Step 10 uploads); Phase 7 human uploads; image generation (explicitly out of scope — tutor reasons-over only). Decisions made 06/15: foundation-first, reason-over-only, lectures per-course-all-included.

(Original context below.) Tutor/student/judge were previously **text-only**; `main_ui` passed only prose exercise descriptions even when a real figure existed.

**Three goals:**
1. Accept images as input (students attaching figures; tutor receiving curriculum figures).
2. Reason over / produce image-based outputs where relevant.
3. Add lecture transcripts as part of tutor context.

**Already on disk but unread:** figure PNGs live under `curriculum/<course>/figures/` (convention `exercise_<NN>_<desc>.{png,jpg,jpeg}`), documented in `curriculum/README.md`. Nothing reads them yet.

**Phase 6 plan (NOT STARTED):** new `utils/figures.py` (`discover_figures`, `image_to_data_url`, `build_multimodal_content`) feeding tutor/student/judge via LangChain normalized multimodal content (works for both GPT and Claude). Additive transcript `figures` field. Phase 7 = per-message human uploads in the chat composer (now lands in the Sandbox composer, not the old config panel). main_ui Step 10 (image uploads) is blocked on Phase 6.

**Why:** Important for courses where diagrams/visuals/lecture-specific explanations matter; the immediate cases are exercise_04 (Power/Actors Map) and exercise_08 (Spider Diagram) in cities_and_climate_change.

**How to apply:** When this work starts, build `utils/figures.py` first (mirror the `utils/parsing.py` pattern), then thread `figures` through tutor → student → judge. Lecture-transcript context is a newer ask not yet specced in PLANNING. See [[project-active-items]].
