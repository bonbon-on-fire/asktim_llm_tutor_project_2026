"""Course key -> human-readable display name for database_ui.

The conversations table stores ``course`` as a curriculum *key* (the folder name,
e.g. ``cities_and_climate_change``). The display name lives in
``curriculum/<key>/course_name.txt`` and is the single source of truth for the
live apps. database_ui's image intentionally excludes ``curriculum/`` (it never
runs the tutor; it only reads the DB), so the names are mirrored here.

When adding a course: copy the contents of its ``course_name.txt`` into the map
below. Unknown keys fall back to a prettified version of the key, so a freshly
added course still renders sensibly until its name is mirrored here.
